## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### DEV_MODE Removed ✅
- **Files:** 3 API files
- **Impact:** API now uses real data via Services

### Critical Findings ✅
- LDPlayerManager: Ready (575 lines, all methods)
- WorkstationManager: Ready (874 lines, all methods)  
- Services: Ready (WorkstationService, EmulatorService)
- Operations: Ready (scan, start, stop, delete, rename)

### Remaining Work 🔄
- Wire Services to Managers (Task 3-4)
- Implement operation methods (Task 2)
- Fix 422 login error (Task 1)
- Test with real machine (Task 5)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### Session 5 (3-4 hours):

1. **Fix login 422 error** (30 min)
   - Debug validation in jwt_auth.py
   - Test with curl
   - Implement fix

2. **Implement operations** (90 min)
   - start_emulator()
   - stop_emulator()
   - delete_emulator()
   - rename_emulator()
   - See templates in NEXT_STEPS.md

3. **Wire LDPlayerManager** (60 min)
   - Into EmulatorService
   - Into WorkstationService
   - Add operation waiting

4. **Final tests** (60 min)
   - Real emulator scanning
   - Real operations
   - Web UI verification
   - Unit tests (32/32)
