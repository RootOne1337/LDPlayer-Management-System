## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Session 6:** Implemented operation methods in EmulatorService
  - `start()` - Queue emulator start operation via LDPlayerManager
  - `stop()` - Queue emulator stop operation via LDPlayerManager
  - `delete()` - Queue emulator delete operation via LDPlayerManager
  - `rename()` - Queue emulator rename operation (NEW METHOD)
  - `batch_start()` - Queue multiple start operations simultaneously (NEW METHOD)
  - `batch_stop()` - Queue multiple stop operations simultaneously (NEW METHOD)
- **Session 6:** Updated API endpoints for all 6 operation methods
  - POST `/{emulator_id}/start` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with operation_id
  - POST `/{emulator_id}/stop` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with operation_id
  - DELETE `/{emulator_id}` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with operation_id
  - POST `/rename` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with operation_id
  - POST `/batch-start` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with batch operations list
  - POST `/batch-stop` - Returns 202 ACCEPTED with batch operations list
- **Session 6:** Async operation queue integration with LDPlayerManager
  - Operations return Dict with operation_id for tracking
  - 202 ACCEPTED responses indicate queued operations
  - Batch operations support for multi-emulator control
- Created SESSION_6_OPERATIONS_SUMMARY.md with complete implementation details

### Fixed
- **Session 6:** Updated 6 unit tests in test_emulator_service.py
  - test_delete_emulator - Now checks Dict structure instead of bool
  - test_delete_nonexistent - Now checks Dict with operation_id
  - test_start_emulator - Now checks operation_type in Dict response
  - test_start_nonexistent - Removed exception expectation, checks operation queued
  - test_stop_emulator - Now checks operation_type in Dict response
  - test_stop_nonexistent - Removed exception expectation, checks operation queued
- **Session 6:** Fixed AsyncMock usage in test fixtures
  - Changed AsyncMock to MagicMock for synchronous LDPlayerManager methods
  - Proper mock setup for manager.start_emulator(), manager.stop_emulator(), etc.

### Changed
- **Session 6:** Modified operation return types from bool to Dict
  - All operation methods now return operation status dictionary
  - Includes operation_id for async tracking
  - Includes operation_type for method identification

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- **Session 5:** Critical bugfix for emulator scanning
  - Fixed EmulatorService.get_all() calling wrong LDPlayerManager method
  - Changed from get_all_emulators() to get_emulators()
  - LDPlayer now correctly shows all emulators in real-time
- Dependency Injection infrastructure (DIContainer)
- Domain entities (Workstation, Emulator)
- Pydantic schemas for API responses
- Custom exception hierarchy (10 exception types)
- BaseService[T] generic template for CRUD operations
- WorkstationService with full CRUD operations
- EmulatorService with full CRUD operations + get_by_workstation filtering
- 23 API endpoints for workstations and emulators management
- JWT authentication with token management
- Request logging and error handling
- Comprehensive test suite (125 tests)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** 32 tests for services (WorkstationService, EmulatorService)
- **Integration Tests:** 7 tests for API routes
- **Security Tests:** 28 tests for JWT and encryption
- **Performance Tests:** 18 tests with caching
- **Total:** 125 tests passing (100% success rate)
